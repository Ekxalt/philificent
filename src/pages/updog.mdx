# Nothing, what's up with you?

I miss when life and things were simpler, not like way back pre-electricity times
no, I'm talking more about the times we used to have where people had "thick-skin",
and sticking up for someone didn't shame them in ways I still don't understand.

The office was an example of the simple we used to live by once, I liked that.
